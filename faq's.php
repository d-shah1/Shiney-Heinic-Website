                                We get it - you guys can’t get enough of the Shiney Heinie, literally! Sometimes
                                when our Bidets start selling like hotcakes, unfortunately we can completely sell
                                out before our next round of stock reaches our fulfilment centre. If this happens,
                                we will put those Bidets up for pre-order before they’ve arrived. We know what
                                date our stock is due to arrive, so this is the date in brackets next to the product
                                name. All orders will then be shipped out to our customers on that specified date.
                                This allows our customers to reserve their favorite pattern and ensure they get
                                their hands on the Bidet of their dreams.

                            We ship our products within 72 hours of us receiving the order but
                            shipping times differ depending on our stock levels. When we run out of
                            stock levels at our U.S based warehouse we will use the second best
                            warehouse that is closest to the vicinity to where you are located.
                            Unfortunately this means longer wait times. At most your product will
                            take 3 weeks to arrive due to international shipping times

                            had a means of using water to clean their rears if not a bidet system for
                            ages now. Water has been proven to do a better job at cleaning your
                            buttox and you can almost instantaneously feel the difference after
                            using Shiney Heinie. Shiney Heinie is not just a cheaper bidet system
                            but a bidet system that has been reinvented and improved so that it
                            suits everyone. Not only is Shiney Heinie more hygienic, but it can
                            also help you cut your toilet paper usage down by 75%. As well as, being more environmentally friendly by reducing the tree consumption
                            and water usage per flush.

                            These things happen! Please email us immediately with the subject line CHANGE or
                            CANCEL and we will do our absolute best to carry out your request. If it has already
                            been dispatched from our fulfilment partner you will need to go through our returns
                            process. As we do our best to get your orders out to you as soon as we can, occasionally an
                            order will be processed before the team has a chance to change it. We cannot
                            guarantee a change of order after the order is placed so please select your items
                            carefully.
